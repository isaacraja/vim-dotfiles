# A whole mess of Vim

I recently discovered [pathogen.vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) by Tim Pope in a [post about it by Tammer Saleh](http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen). It's great. I want to use it for everything.

Sadly, lots of Vim scripts, plugins and colors are in every other format in the world. So, this is my short-term (?) solution. I've bundled up a Pathogen-friendly repo with a bunch of my favorite items. Feel free to use it in a gist [like this one](http://gist.github.com/455162). (It's inspired by a short Ruby script Tammer put in his post about Pathogen.)

Below is a short listing of what's here with credit to original authors.

## Colors

+ Dim and DimGrey: I have no idea where I found these, but I like them *a lot*. If I find out who wrote these, I'll add credit info. If you wrote these themes, please let me know and I'll give you credit. Also, if you wrote them: thanks.

## After

I've started using after/ as a way of loading small adaptations to existing
filetype or syntax settings. There's lots in there, so poke around for
details.
